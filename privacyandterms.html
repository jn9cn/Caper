						<h3 class="bold">Privacy Policy</h3>
						<p class="text-center">Thank you for joining Caper! We take your privacy and protection very seriously. Read on for more:</p>
						</div>
						<h4 class="bold">Section 1 - What do we do with your information?</h4>
						<p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.</p>
						<p>When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer's internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.</p>
						<p>Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products and other updates. We will never sell your email information to any other party. Ever. We hate it when companies do that.</p>
						<div class="clear padding-10"></div>
						<h4 class="bold">Section 2 - Consent</h4>
						<p class="boldL dark">How do you get my consent?</p>
						<p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
						<p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>					
						<p class="boldL dark">How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
						<p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at <span class="boldL"><a href="mailto:info@caper.ly" target="_blank" >info@caper.ly</a></span> or mailing us at: Kichin Inc, 120 E 23rd Street, New York, NY, 10010, United States</p>
						<div class="clear padding-10"></div>
						<h4 class="bold">Section 3 - Disclosure</h4>
						<p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
						<div class="clear padding-10"></div>
						<h4 class="bold">Section 4 - Payments</h4>
						<p>We use Braintree(TM) for payment related transactions. Braintree(TM) is a full-stack payments platform from PayPal(TM) and fully uses PCI compliant technology. We do not store any of the payment related information (including but not limited to Credit card number, CVV) in our web servers.</p>
						<div class="clear padding-10"></div>
						<h4 class="bold">Section 5 - Third-party services</h4>
						<p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
						<p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
						<p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
						<p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
						<p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
						<p>Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>
						<p class="boldL dark">Links</p>
						<p>When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
						<div class="clear padding-10"></div>
						<h4 class="bold">Section 6 - Security</h4>
						<p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
						<p>Please see detailed security information, Braintree Security Info, <span class="boldL"><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/developers/security" target="_blank">here</a></span>.

						<div class="clear padding-10"></div>
